# RockBandBoots
Mini project


 # Project name: Rock Band
 
The project is based on a 60's band called the black seeds, is a made up band that takes content from three different 
rock bands from the 60's and 80's, Pink Floyd, Scorpions and U2.
I chose this bands as they are among my favorites and I use content from google, mostly for pictures,
twitter, youtube and spotify.
As the project is a test project I decided to use links to some different bands just to show the functionality 


# UX

Following the guidelines, the content is clearly organised in pages which are easy accessed form the navigation bar.
all pages are responsive and set to show content depending of screen size

the page is based on a simple format in which every page shows concrete information about the band's news, discography, tour as the
availability to be hired for private events.

As now a days social media is so important I decided the twitter aside was important to have, but as I'm using a made up 
band I decided to use the twitter feed from one of the bands I used for content and pictures, to show the twitter feed working

Similar access to social media was used in the Media page to link media as music from spotify and videos from youtube to 
give this modern look to the page, one interview with a band was added to give more content to the page (local content).

The gallery was a bit problematic as I wanted to avoid using java technologies, focusing on the front end development, the bootstrap carousel was a good addition to the page as previously I had just thumbnails as links to pictures.

#Technologies Used

HTML5,
CSS,
Bootstrap 4.1,
SASS,
github, 
git bash, 
pycharm,
adobe Illustrator(Wireframes),
google fonts,
font awesome


# Testing

- The grid was implemented with bootstrap 4 which brings lots of new features as the classic ones.

- the use of SASS came later in development, as this is my first html web development with multiple pages
I saw it fit to start using SASS in order to create a solid base to the development 

- the web page needed to be responsive in all screens, following the media queries all screens where tested in order to
adjust the content and size of fonts, pictures and components.

- the idea of having the navigation bar in the middle of the main page created problems in the development and was changed to
have a better structure in all pages 

- the page history was replaced by discography not to over extend the development of the mini project 

- the challenge was to make the spotify and twitter components responsive, taking a look to tutorials explaining responsiveness
they are now responding to screen size 

- git hub pages was implemented successfully.
